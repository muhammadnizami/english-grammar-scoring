<s>Dear Friend </s>
<s>As the number of people ill with AIDS increases so does the need for volunteers to care for them . </s>
<s>Over the last three years , our volunteers have provided much love and care to many hurt and lonely people . </s>
<s>The support our volunteers provide can not be measured in purely practical terms and their continuing contribution is vital if we are to provide an ongoing service . </s>
<s>In recognition of their importance and the need to train more volunteers , we want to develop links with individual churches . </s>
<s>To do this , we would like to recruit people who are willing to be an ACET-link in their church . </s>
<s>An ACET-link person , possibly an existing volunteer , would keep their church informed about our work and encourage people to consider becoming volunteers , help with fundraising ideas and circulate newsletters . </s>
<s>An ACET-link will play a vital role as our work is growing so rapidly . </s>

<s>Living with AIDS by John Creedy </s>
<s>You can be perfectly well with HIV and at other times chronic debility makes it hard to do even the basic things . </s>
<s>In the early days the stigma of being HIV positive had driven away about 60% of my circle of friends . </s>
<s>Despite the publicity giving the facts surrounding the transmission of the disease , ignorance was such that they became afraid of normal social contact . </s>
<s>It soon became clear that I could no longer rely on friends for help with everyday chores like shopping and housework when I needed it . </s>
<s>While deciding to stay as independent as possible , I contacted ACET who I knew provided practical care at home . </s>
<s>I had previously spent about two years asking local social services and friends for help and not having it happen , so my flat had become pretty run down . </s>
<s>There was also the question of my own exhaustion . </s>
<s>Even a weekly visit by a local authority home help — when it was finally arranged — was not enough . </s>
<s>Help provided by ACET volunteers eventually go the flat ship-shape again and life became easier . </s>
<s>Illnesses , including chronic muscle debility , herpes , tremors and eye infections , have come and gone . </s>
<s>Recently I have experienced serious and potentially fatal fevers . </s>
<s>Basically every day is an effort , that 's the reality , and there 's a great tendency to want life to be as it was . </s>
<s>I have far fewer friends and I am partially sighted , which makes me a lot more vulnerable ; but whatever happens physically , I have always said that it was what happened mentally that mattered . </s>
<s>Being aware of the stress and pressure that many people and their families experience when AIDS or HIV is first diagnosed , I became involved in counselling . </s>
<s>I have also campaigned for the Government to give AIDS greater recognition , not as a disease affecting specific sectors of the community , but as a social problem for which there must be adequate welfare provision . </s>
<s>Organisations like ACET need this support to enable people like myself to retain maximum control and continue to live at home as independently as we can . </s>
<s>I have in recent years edited a self-help journal for people with AIDS , written for the national press and researched a variety of medical material for television . </s>
<s>Without the help of ACET and other direct service organisations and charities , I would not have been able to continue and maintain my independence . </s>
<s>By working co-operatively , long-term , with the people around me , I hope to continue for some time yet . </s>

<s>After spending some time , often years , with us , people move on to other things and we need to fill the gaps . ’ </s>
<s>All volunteers are trained in a programme designed to : — give a broad knowledge of HIV and AIDS — equip an individual on an emotional and practical level to enable them to give compassionate and unconditional care — equip them to give practical support </s>
<s>The training programme itself covers key subjects including : — death and dying — sex and sexuality — responses and reactions — medical facts — grief and loss </s>
<s>In London , volunteer training programmes will now take place every September and February and will require an individual 's time for one evening a week over a six-week programme . </s>

<s>Issue 1 </s>
<s>AIDS In London Changing Fast </s>
<s>MAJOR CHANGES in the pattern of HIV disease occurring in the capital which are not obvious from published statistics . </s>
<s>The biggest changes are in the length of time people ill with the disease are now surviving and in the nature of the illnesses themselves . </s>
<s>Between 1984 and 1986 those with AIDS died on average some ten months after diagnosis . </s>
<s>Between 1987 and 1989 , however , the survival period has already doubled to twenty moths . </s>
<s>Patients diagnosed more recently are probably surviving an average of longer than two years . </s>
<s>Cause of death </s>
<s>The ‘ cause of death ’ figures are also changing beyond all recognition . </s>
<s>The classical pneumocystis pneumonia used to be the final event in the disease process in almost half ( 46% ) of those with AIDS in 1986 . </s>
<s>While pneumonia is still a common occurrence , current preventative measures and improved treatment have reduced the numbers dying as a result to only 3% by 1989 . </s>
<s>This change has big implications for health planners and for those caring for people with AIDS . </s>
<s>With the pneumonias , the interval between early chest infection and death could be as little as 12 hours in someone outwardly fit and well . </s>
<s>Planning was often difficult or impossible and the need for home care was less . </s>
<s>The commonest cause of death is now advanced Kaposi 's Sarcoma ( a kind of cancer ) . </s>
<s>Slowly growing internal lesions can produce great difficulties in the lung and the gut , causing shortness of breath and other problems . </s>
<s>Internal Kaposi 's Sarcoma can be very painful . </s>
<s>Surviving longer </s>
<s>Over a year or two , therefore , we have shifted from a population of recently diagnosed AIDS patients , often reasonably well but with lives dominated by a threat of pneumonia , to a population surviving longer and developing a range of further complex problems of a chronic debilitating nature . </s>
<s>As London 's largest independent provider of community care for people ill with AIDS , staff at ACET have seen these changes unfold in the home . </s>
<s>While numbers of new AIDS cases reported officially each month have remained relatively steady , there has been a big increase in those needing expert medical and nursing advice at home with a 24-hour on call back up . </s>
<s>The numbers with pain are also higher . </s>
<s>Those at home often need opiates ( morphine-like medicines ) for pain , while one in five will also need a special battery-operated syringe pump , especially if they are too weak to swallow . </s>
<s>Specialist care </s>
<s>The picture then has changed and we now need to plan for increasing numbers of those with chronic illnesses needing specialist community care — not just volunteers , although volunteers continue to have a vitally important role to play . </s>
<s>Until the numbers of deaths each month has risen to equal or exceed the number of new diagnoses , the numbers needing care will continue to rise fast , even if the number of new cases reported in official figures is relatively constant or falling . </s>
<s>These factors help explain some of the reasons why the total number of ACET clients covered at any one time by our on call service in London has more than doubled from 70 in April 1990 to over 150 by March 1991 ; and why the nature of the services required has become so much more sophisticated . </s>
<s>Professionally-based community care is here to stay and is increasingly needed , backed by access to respite and long stay hospice beds and acute ward facilities . </s>
<s>Forward planning and good communication are the two foundation stones that must be in place to guarantee that people ill with HIV have the best choices and continue to enjoy the very best quality of life , wherever they choose to be . </s>

<s>Care-link units , designed to provide remote signalling of distress via the telephone systems , are currently on loan with seven clients in London . </s>
<s>Designed originally with the needs of the elderly in mind , those ill with HIV/AIDS at home are also finding them enormously valuable . </s>
<s>Help can be summoned from ACET or other services merely by pressing a button on a pendant worn around the neck . </s>
<s>This can make all the difference to someone who feels unsafe alone at home or to partners or friends . </s>
<s>Referrals to ACET for Home Care in the London area have increased in the last six months by 50% . </s>
<s>At the present rate of referral , numbers are more than set to double during the year . </s>
<s>Around 85% of those cared for in the capital are gay men , with an increasing number of women and children . </s>

<s>UK OPERATIONS DIRECTOR APPOINTED </s>
<s>Peter Johnson , 38 , has been appointed UK Operations Director , with responsibility for ACET 's existing operations and for new developments within the UK . </s>
<s>The rapid growth of ACET since its inception in 1988 has made the creation of this new post a priority . </s>
<s>‘ I was impressed by the care given to our clients in London and elsewhere , ’ explained Peter , ‘ and the lengths to which ACET staff go to try and meet the needs of clients . </s>
<s>I feel that working in partnership with the client , and with other agencies , is the most effective way of ensuring the needs of our clients are met . ’ </s>
<s>Peter studied astronomy at University College , London , and worked in accountancy for a short spell before deciding upon a career in nursing . </s>

<s>‘ I basically managed district nurses , health visitors , school and family planning nurses , ’ he said . </s>
<s>Kay , an ACET nurse , visits a client to administer Petamadine to help prevent him developing pneumocystis corinii pneumonia ( PCP ) . </s>
<s>CHILDREN WITH HIV </s>
<s>The plight of children infected with HIV was recently highlighted by Princess Diana when she presented a report by the National Children 's Bureau to a London conference on the impact of AIDS on family life . </s>
<s>ACET already has experience in caring for children ill with the disease , particularly through its Scottish office . </s>
<s>In the experience of ACET staff and volunteers , practical care in the home not only benefits the HIV infected individual but the whole family , which can often mean three generations . </s>
<s>At least 60%of the individuals being cared for by ACET in Tayside also have children themselves . </s>
<s>Some of these children are infected , but those who are not are still affected by HIV . </s>
<s>ACET believes that specialist and volunteer home care is a vital factor in helping to keep families together and lessening the trauma involved when family members are diagnosed HIV positive . </s>
<s>PORTSMOUTH OFFICE </s>

<s>( Portsmouth AIDS Link Support ) and the Link Project . </s>

<s>There was also the question of my own exhaustion . </s>
<s>Even a weekly visit by a local authority home help when it was finally arranged was not enough . </s>
<s>Help provided by an ACET volunteer eventually got the flat ship-shape again and life became easier . </s>
<s>Illnesses , including chronic muscle debility , herpes , tremors and eye infections , have come and gone . </s>
<s>Recently I have experienced series and potentially fatal fevers . </s>
<s>Basically every day is an effort , that 's the reality , and there 's a great tendency to want life to be as it was . </s>
<s>I have far few friends and I am partially sighted , which makes me a lot more vulnerable ; but whatever happens physically , I have always said that it was what happened mentally that mattered . </s>
<s>Being aware of the stress and pressures that many people and their families experience with AIDS or HIV is first diagnoses , I became involved in counselling . </s>
<s>I have also campaigned for the Government to give AIDS greater recognition , not as a disease affecting specific sectors of the community , but as a social problem for which there must be adequate welfare provision . </s>
<s>Organisations like ACET need this kind of support to enable people like myself to retain maximum control and continue to live at home . </s>
<s>I have in recent years edited a self-help journal for people with AIDS , written for the national press and researched a variety of medical material for television . </s>
<s>Without the help of ACET and other similar organisations I would not have been able to continue and maintain my independence . </s>
<s>By working co-operatively , longterm , with the people around me , I hope to continue for some time yet . </s>

<s>Area Profile EALING </s>
<s>IN JANUARY 1988 a small group of 50 would-be volunteers met in the Ealing YMCA to learn about AIDS . </s>
<s>This was the beginning of ACET . </s>
<s>Many of the first group completed a training course to provide practical help in the home for a small number of people ill with HIV/AIDS . </s>
<s>The first referrals came from Ealing , Acton and surrounding areas . </s>
<s>This was coordinated from the living room of a local doctor . </s>
<s>The remit of this fledgling group was to provide the highest standards of unconditional care to men , women and children ill at home with HIV/AIDS . </s>
<s>Within a short space of time referrals were regularly coming in . </s>
<s>In June 1988 ACET was officially launched as a registered charity . </s>
<s>Over the next six months this small group of professionals and volunteers provided practical care for 15 people living in or around the Borough of Ealing . </s>
<s>To date ACET has provided professional nursing care or practical help to over 400 individuals across London , excluding hardship grants and equipment loans . </s>
<s>In Ealing alone we have received over 30 referrals for Home Care . </s>
<s>It has always been ACET 's policy to work with and complement statutory and other voluntary organizations . </s>
<s>In Ealing , social workers , H.E.A.R.S ( Hounslow & Ealing AIDS Response Service ) and the Ealing Home Support team have made referrals to ACET to provide for needs where a single agency can not give all of the support required . </s>
<s>Likewise ACET has also involved other agencies on behalf of the client . </s>
<s>Both the Borough and Health Authority have supported the work of ACET in Ealing by being among the first to provide financial support . </s>
<s>ACET is currently working with the Health Authority to develop a service level agreement for 1991/92 . </s>
<s>A Day in the Life of an ACET Volunteer </s>
<s>Monday 8.55am — I arrive at the office for what looks like a quiet day catching up on necessary office work and telephoning some of our low-dependency clients to see how they are . </s>
<s>There 's a message on the answerphone from Tony 's brother . </s>
<s>Tony has been unwell over the weekend . </s>
<s>One of the nurses rings back , discusses the situation and says she will ring the hospital and/or his GP to see what can be done . </s>
<s>I am asked if I can be on standby if transport is needed ? </s>
<s>9.32am — Diary check — a general discussion of appointments and availability for the week follow with Janet , our Co-ordinator . </s>
<s>This includes nurses and volunteers . </s>
<s>At the moment it looks like my usual stint of ironing on Thursday and shopping on Friday are the main fixtures , but anything can happen before then . </s>
<s>10.10am — Still no decision about Tony . </s>
<s>We are now waiting for the specialist to phone back . </s>
<s>Meanwhile , another cry for help . </s>
<s>Westminster Hospital , say that Andrew , on of their patients , needs to be admitted but they are unable to find transport as no ambulance is available . </s>
<s>No other organisation can help . </s>
<s>We agree to help and perhaps I can combine the two visits . </s>
<s>11.00am — Tony has been given an appointment at the local hospital . </s>
<s>I will be able to take him and continue into London to pick up Andrew . </s>
<s>At least I 'll be able to have lunch first and not be munching my sandwich in a traffic jam . </s>
<s>1.04pm — Tony , and his Mum , are still getting ready to arrive . </s>
<s>He is not at all well , very breathless , and by the time we are in the care he is gasping for air . </s>
<s>1.05pm — Having left Tony and his Mum at his appointment , I set off in the direction of the A4 . </s>
<s>2.30pm — I arrive at Andrew 's house . </s>
<s>Although he is suffering from a type of septicaemia , he is clearly having a good spell . </s>
<s>We make the most of this and scoot off to the hospital . </s>
<s>3.35pm — Arrive back at hospital no.1 . </s>
<s>Tony is to be admitted but … wait for it … to yet another hospital ! </s>
<s>If I ca n't take him he will have a two-hour wait for an ambulance . </s>
<s>I 've heard of a pub crawl … but a hospital crawl ? </s>
<s>4.00pm — We set off again ; this time via Tony 's home to collect a variety of possessions , finally arriving at hospital no.3 . </s>
<s>4.55pm — Tony is ushered into a side ward with three doctors and I stay outside with Mum . </s>
<s>The only problem is , she is Ugandan and speaks very little English , has no idea how to get home and has no money for transport . </s>
<s>I try to explain that , unlike her home country , she will not be staying in with him . </s>
<s>Nobody seems to have explained this to her , but finally she understands . </s>
<s>Her daughters have however been contacted so I agree to keep her company until they arrive . </s>
<s>5.45pm — They finally turn up . </s>
<s>As the doctors are still with Tony , I explain the position to the daughters and hand Mum over to them . </s>
<s>6.30pm — Home at last ! </s>
<s>Of course , I still need to catch up on that necessary office work , maybe tomorrow … </s>
