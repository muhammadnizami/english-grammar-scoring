<s>AGEISM </s>
<s>THE FOUNDATION OF AGE DISCRIMINATION </s>
<s>STEVE SCRUTTON </s>
<s>Steve Scrutton is a social work manager in Northamptonshire . </s>
<s>After a varied career in teaching , he became involved with older people while taking a postgraduate degree and training as a social worker . </s>
<s>He believes that older people have had a raw deal , and through his writing he hopes to show where things have gone wrong and how more positive attitudes could be developed . </s>
<s>His first book Counselling Older People was published as part of the Age Concern Handbook series . </s>
<s>His forthcoming one is to be about ageing and health . </s>
<s>MY father died in 1979 , aged 76 . </s>
<s>After a period of normal grieving , my mother , who was then 74 , decided that she wanted to travel from Norwich to Northamptonshire to visit me , a journey of about 100 miles . </s>
<s>Previously , she would have been driven by my father , but she announced that it was her intention to travel , alone , by train . </s>
<s>My first reaction was that she was to do no such thing . </s>
<s>I would go to Norwich and bring her myself . </s>
<s>My second reaction was to let her do as she wished . </s>
<s>After all , what were the reasons for not allowing her to travel alone ? </s>
<s>Indeed , she insisted on it , and did the entire trip by herself . </s>
<s>My initial reaction had been a prime , although mild , example of ageism in operation . </s>
<s>My mother was quite capable of making the journey but , because of her age , I had felt that it would be wrong for me to allow her to undertake it . </s>
<s>Such a decision , if carried through , would have been debilitating for my mother , who would have been made to feel dependent , no longer capable of making decisions for herself , or acting independently . </s>
<s>Instead , she had not been a burden , either in my mind or , more importantly , in her own . </s>
<s>She had demonstrated her independence and proven conclusively that her age was not a barrier . </s>
<s>This form of patronising ageism is common where there is genuine care for ageing people . </s>
<s>We do not allow older people to work , because they are old . </s>
<s>We protect older people from harm , real and imaginary , because we do not believe they can protect themselves . </s>
<s>Our concern restricts their ability to fend for themselves . </s>
<s>We clean their homes , fetch their shopping , ferry them to where they wish to go ; and we do all this without thinking that our care might be undermining their independence , even their morale . </s>
<s>We prevent them from taking risks , discourage them from taking physical exercise , and even deny their sexuality . </s>
<s>In many subtle ways our care demonstrates that we believe the ageing process makes independent action impossible . </s>
<s>The reason we do so is entirely based on our perception of what older people should and should not be allowed to do for themselves — at their age . </s>
<s>There is another , more pernicious form of ageism . </s>
<s>This is the ageism that arises from neglect , and from discounting the needs of older people . </s>
<s>It is not based on compassion . </s>
<s>Instead it deprives older people of social status and role , undermines their self-esteem , and denies them a fair share of social resources . </s>
<s>Why else do we insist that older people can not be employed after a certain age ? </s>
<s>Why else do we ensure that when they retire they receive subsistence-level pensions ? </s>
<s>Why else do we frequently talk of the ‘ demographic trends ’ , implying that older people are a burden ? </s>
<s>Why else is the care of frail , dependent older people in hospitals and residential care so frequently a disgrace ? </s>
<s>And why else has the abuse of older people failed to become more of a social issue ? </s>
<s>What is ageism ? </s>
<s>The attitudes which dominate any society usually reflect the interests of the most powerful and influential social groups . </s>
<s>Such attitudes may not be shared by everyone , but are accepted by most people without question . </s>
<s>Where the assumptions made about old age are negative they lead to ageism , which treats older people not as individuals but as a homogeneous group which can be discriminated against . </s>
<s>Ageism creates and fosters prejudices about the nature and experience of old age . </s>
<s>These usually project unpleasant images of older people which subtly undermine their personal value and worth . </s>
<s>Commonly held ideas restrict the social role and status of older people , structure their expectations of themselves , prevent them achieving their potential and deny them equal opportunities . </s>
<s>Ageism , so defined , is broader than age discrimination . </s>
<s>The reason for the discriminatory practices described throughout this book can not be fully understood and tackled without reference to the concept of ageism . </s>
<s>The social process of ageism </s>
<s>Each society defines and reacts to older people in ways which are often subtly , sometimes fundamentally , different from each other . </s>
<s>The popularly held view of old age today is of very old people , usually women , living alone , socially isolated , managing on inadequate incomes , poorly housed , suffering ill health , dependent on younger carers , yet isolated from their families . </s>
<s>Unhappy , withdrawn , but at the same time not interested in making new friends , they have lost their energy , enthusiasm and drive , and are no longer concerned with education or personal development . </s>
<s>Their deteriorating physical and mental health offers only the prospect of further decline and the ultimate sentence of old age — death . </s>
<s>This depressing but widely held view of life in old age is the foundation upon which judgements are made about individual worth . </s>
<s>It pervades the outlook and expectations of young and old alike , influencing their understanding and appreciation of the nature of old age . </s>
<s>It forms the basis for contempt on the part of the young and strong for the old and weak , and the increasing fear of human mortality which old age seems to represent so vividly . </s>
<s>Older people have absorbed these attitudes which they once held as young people , and lead their lives in ways which confirm the stereotyped images , and perpetuate the myths of ageism from generation to generation . </s>
<s>Racism , classism , disablism and sexism have developed through similar social processes . </s>
<s>While they have much in common , ageism is perhaps different in two major respects . </s>
<s>First , older people do not form an exclusive group , but one of which every individual will eventually become a member . </s>
<s>The white racist will never be black ; the male sexist will never be female ; but the young ageist will grow old . </s>
<s>Second , the discrimination which emanates from ageism can appear to result from the natural process of biological ageing rather than social creation . </s>
<s>It is important to emphasise that the concept of ageism does not deny the ageing process , but rather seeks to distinguish between — on the one hand — ageing as a process of physiological decline and — on the other — the social phenomenon which forms the basis of the disadvantage and oppression of older people . </s>
<s>Any consideration of ageism has to be clear about the difference . </s>
<s>The social creation of ageism </s>
<s>If different cultures , at different times , value older people in different ways , it indicates that our stereotypes are socially rather than biologically created . </s>
<s>It is useful to confirm this in order to counter the popular idea that discrimination against older people arises entirely from the nature of old age . </s>
<s>Former civilisations have regarded and treated older people in very different ways . </s>
<s>The historian , Minois , has delved systematically into the changing status of older people in history , and he has been able to link these changes to the dominant social ideas and circumstances of the time . </s>
<s>In ancient Greece , the cult of youth and beauty , and the reverence for the elderly Homeric sage , created an ambivalence which has typified attitudes towards older people throughout history . </s>
<s>In the Roman Empire , this ambivalence was demonstrated by the important role played by senior citizens , on the one hand , and their cruel subjection to the literary satire of the time on the other . </s>
<s>In the Christian tradition , the image of the revered holy sage was contrasted with the condemnation of the ageing sinner . </s>
<s>Throughout history , two main factors have contributed to these historical fluctuations in the fortune of older people : physical strength , and the value placed on acquired knowledge and experience . </s>
<s>Physical strength has always been highly regarded . </s>
<s>The theory of the ‘ survival of the fittest ’ predicts that the old and weak must eventually succumb to the young and strong , and that this is necessary for the future vitality of the species . </s>
<s>Social life based on this condition can hardly be favourable to older people , and the more turbulent and anarchical the times , the worse their condition and status has been . </s>
<s>It is the loss of strength associated with old age that has permitted and continues to permit the abuse of older people . </s>
<s>The respect once given to older people for their knowledge and experience has suffered as a result of several factors : the decline of custom , the acceleration of change and the loss of oral traditions . </s>
<s>Civilisations which pass on their learning and experience verbally have to rely on older citizens to provide the vital link between generations . </s>
<s>The development of writing and the widespread circulation of books undermined the importance of memory , thereby destroying one of the most useful social functions provided by older people . </s>
<s>For these reasons , prejudice against age is certainly not new . </s>
<s>Aristotle ( 384–322 BC ) , in his Rhetoric , accused older people of every conceivable fault . </s>
<s>He described them as cowardly , hesitant , selfish , timorous , suspicious , fearful , parsimonious , miserly , small-minded , ill-humoured and avaricious . </s>
<s>This form of ageism has probably always existed . </s>
<s>It is unlikely that there has ever been a golden age , in which elders have been respected solely for their age . </s>
<s>There has always been a close correlation between the status of older people , and their personal achievement . </s>
<s>The greater the past achievement and the higher the social class , the more status individuals have been able to maintain in old age . </s>
<s>Among the poor the situation has always been more difficult . </s>
<s>When older people were no longer able to fend for themselves , they became a burden of no further value , and often ended their lives despised and in extreme poverty . </s>
<s>Despite these disadvantages , many older people have been able to maintain their social status by remaining active , alert and healthy . </s>
<s>The ability to maintain physical and mental powers has allowed some individuals to pursue their chosen careers regardless of their age . </s>
<s>They are the exceptions that prove the rule , ‘ the rule ’ being the dominant expectations of the time . </s>
<s>The evidence of Western civilisation suggests that the status of older people has been generally low , but variably so . </s>
<s>While it was low in ancient Greece , it was higher in the Hellenistic world . </s>
<s>Similarly , it was higher during the early centuries of the Roman republic than in the later Empire period , and while it was low during the turbulence of the early Middle Ages , it reached a peak in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries , when the importance of older people was enhanced by their ability to survive the plagues of the era . </s>
<s>Thus , although capitalism is blamed by many workers for the treatment older people receive today , it is clear that ageism has a history which long predates this form of social organisation . </s>
<s>However , the human disruption caused by the agricultural and industrial revolutions did produce in the West a social environment which was particularly unfavourable to older people . </s>
<s>If they were unable to take part in hard productive work , they became surplus to the manpower requirements of the new industrial society . </s>
<s>This led to two main developments . </s>
<s>Initially , older people were removed from the community supports which traditionally looked after them and subjected to the rigours of a ‘ work or starve ’ philosophy . </s>
<s>Subsequently , nineteenth-century philanthropy sought to protect older people from the worst impacts of the economic climate , and such efforts culminated in the introduction of pension legislation . </s>
<s>Unfortunately , through fixed ages for the receipt of pensions , these reforms also forcibly prevented older people being productive members of the society and thereby reduced their social status . </s>
<s>Longevity was once a rarer phenomenon than it is in the late twentieth century . </s>
<s>As such , it evoked curiosity and some awe . </s>
<s>In a time when birthrates are decreasing in many countries , it creates fear . </s>
<s>In Britain where there has been a continuing decline in the birthrate this century , politicians who talk about the ‘ burden ’ of old age reveal their concern that a smaller working population will be forced to support a growing number of retired people . </s>
<s>This number will grow dramatically as the baby boom generation reaches retirement in the twenty-first century ( see table opposite ) . </s>
<s>In the next 30 years , Britain expects the number of people over 65 to increase by 20% and the number of people over 84 to increase by 47% . </s>
<s>This prospect has led to a retrenchment in state pension provision and an emphasis on informal caring systems , two attempts to reduce the need for society to foot the bill of its ageing population . </s>
<s>The elderly population in Great Britain : past , present and future </s>
<s>Projections for the future ( made in 1987 ) </s>
<s>In the first column of figures , the size of the population is given in thousands . </s>
<s>In the second column , the number is expressed as a percentage of the total population of the country . </s>
<s>The status of older people is also dependent on the social context in which people live , and this is made apparent by the wide variation in ageing patterns in different ethnic , geographic and socio-economic sub-cultures . </s>
<s>In some cultures , older people are deprived of esteem , suffer severe neglect and , in extreme cases , the frail and weak are simply left to die . </s>
<s>Far Eastern cultures appear to be the most favourable in which to grow old . </s>
<s>Elders are widely respected and have high social status . </s>
<s>Yet even here deference for old age is not universal or unconditional but is based upon personal achievements or the special knowledge and skills that the individual can offer . </s>
<s>Moreover , when these societies become industrialised and urbanised another set of values begins to undermine these time-honoured traditions . </s>
<s>The respect for elders in Japan is gradually waning as a result . </s>
<s>A similar weakening of traditional cultural values can be witnessed in Britain , where Asian communities have now been subjected to dominant Western values for several generations . </s>
<s>There has developed what has been described as a ‘ transition trap ’ , experienced by the generation which has cared for their elders in the traditional manner , but whose children have increasingly embraced Western lifestyles , and fail to fulfil customary expectations about caring for their parents . </s>
<s>This pattern of cultural change is one of the clearest indications of the powerful impact that dominant social attitudes and values have on the status and treatment of older people . </s>
<s>Both historical and cultural comparisons indicate that the ideas we have about old age are as important , probably more important than biological ageing in determining the way old age is perceived , and how older people are treated . </s>
<s>Where the status of older people is low , it is because these attitudes determine that it will be low , not because it is a natural consequence of the ageing process . </s>
<s>This raises the important question of where our ageism originates . </s>
<s>Ageism and the process of socialisation </s>
<s>From birth onwards we are all presented with unflattering images of old age . </s>
<s>There has never been a time more conscious of chronological age than our own . </s>
<s>Life is presented as a succession of ‘ ages ’ : from birth , through babyhood , infancy , childhood , adolescence , adulthood , middle age and finally old age . </s>
<s>Youth represents potential for future growth and development , a time of hope and expectation . </s>
<s>Thereafter all is decline , with an increasing if unspoken fear of ageing . </s>
<s>It is this process of socialisation — the gradual adoption of values and norms associated with social roles — which generates ageism . </s>
<s>Infants do not discriminate on the basis of age . </s>
<s>Their judgement of people is based entirely on whether they are treated gently or harshly , kindly or unkindly , with love or with disdain . </s>
<s>It is socialisation that transforms ageing into something that is to be feared , and leads us to believe that older people are to be pitied . </s>
<s>Many school textbooks , from the earliest readers , portray older people as clumsy , frail , pathetic , and needing to be helped across roads , while younger members of the family are happily enjoying an exciting and glamorous life . </s>
<s>Many pre-school poetry collections include material which presents negative images of older people . </s>
<s>These early influences are probably the first to make an impression on the minds of young children , and this impression is confirmed in later school years , not least in classic literature . </s>
<s>In Shakespeare 's As You Like It , for example , the melancholy Jacques describes old age as : </s>
<s>‘ … second childishness and mere oblivion , </s>
<s>Sans teeth , sans eyes , sans taste , sans everything . ’ </s>
<s>Our education system also subtly confirms the ageist idea that older people are not educable and are not interested in personal development . </s>
<s>The very foundation of our modern system , the 1944 Education Act , discusses the education of ‘ the people ’ but effectively means the education of those between 5 and 16 years . </s>
<s>Adults have no statutory rights to education and , as one educational gerontologist writes , ‘ if adult education is marginalised then the education of older adults is marginalised to the margins of the margin . ’ </s>
<s>Language is another powerful method of structuring attitudes about old age . </s>
<s>In this area our language is highly expressive and almost invariably derogatory , infantilising or pitying . </s>
<s>Words and phrases in common usage , such as ‘ mutton dressed as lamb ’ , ‘ dirty old man ’ , ‘ silly old woman ’ , ‘ old fogies ’ , ‘ old ducks ’ , ‘ old biddy ’ , ‘ old codger ’ , ‘ old dears ’ and ‘ old folk ’ all conjure up images which leave little doubt about the nature and experience of old age . </s>
<s>Nor is the impact confined to popular expressions . </s>
<s>Roget 's Thesaurus , a classic English text which seeks to arrange words ‘ according to the ideas which they express ’ , describes old age by such nouns as ‘ senility , grey hairs , climacteric , declining years , decrepitude , hoary age , caducity , superannuation , second childhood , dotage , decline of life ’ and , even more graphically , by the adjectives ‘ senile , run to seed , declining , waning , past one 's prime , grey , hoary , venerable , time-worn , antiquated , doddering , decrepit , superannuated , stricken in years , wrinkled , having one foot in the grave . ’ </s>
<s>The assumption that old people are rigid , less capable , less willing to adapt to new developments , and unable to change is firmly rooted in modern psychological theory . </s>
<s>The father of modern psychology , Sigmund Freud believed ‘ … psychiatry is not possible near or above the age of 50 ; the elasticity of the mental processes on which the treatment depends is as a rule lacking — old people are not educable . ’ </s>
<s>This view has had an influential impact on psychology , and although some might now consider such ideas outmoded , they continue to have an enduring effect on public perceptions of old age . </s>
<s>The association between age , adaptability , and psychological theory remains one of the major factors that disables older people , particularly within a society in which ‘ change ’ and ‘ progress ’ are increasingly important . </s>
<s>Ageism is also firmly rooted in our pervasively influential religious beliefs . </s>
<s>Many religions encourage the idea that our current condition is temporary , and that old age should be a time of looking towards our place in the next life which is more important . </s>
<s>Suffering is part of our preparation for the hereafter . </s>
<s>Death , our link to a better world , is to be welcomed rather than feared . </s>
<s>Happiness and fulfilment will be abundantly available in heaven , valhalla , or nirvana . </s>
<s>The impact of religious belief on the attitudes to life of older people is particularly strong . </s>
<s>These attitudes in Christian tradition can be traced back to ideas which linked old men with the image of sin , and old age as a curse and a punishment . </s>
<s>In Western tradition , the belief that a normal lifespan was the biblical ‘ three score years and ten ’ has shaped the expectations of older people , and justified a lack of social provision . </s>
<s>Medical opinion is another influential source of dominant social attitudes , and its views on ageing are central to the expectations we have about the ‘ normal ’ condition of older people . </s>
<s>A common image of health in old age is one associated with the loss of energy and personal drive , significantly greater need for rest , long and increasing periods of sickness , permanent experience of pain and discomfort , increasing immobility , the gradual loss of personal control and responsibility , the onset of incontinence , with the resulting loss of dignity and self-respect , increasing confusion , and ultimately the most feared condition of all , senility . </s>
<s>The image of old age as a time of pain , illness and disease has often implied that older people actually owe their continuing existence to medical expertise alone . </s>
<s>Unfortunately , comments made by some doctors to older people nurture and encourage the view that pain , illness and disease are an unavoidable feature of normal ageing . </s>
<s>The biological assumptions involved in such statements are based on a series of half-truths about the ageing process , extended so that they appear to support explanations about the nature of life and health in old age that are not justified by the facts . </s>
<s>For instance , while brain cells do die and are not replaced , their loss is not an explanation for senility . </s>
<s>Yet through such biological ‘ explanations ’ , dementia is perceived as part of the normal , natural process of ageing . </s>
<s>Moreover , once this premise is accepted there is less reason to seek to cure it ; pain , illness and disease become an accepted consequence of old age . </s>
<s>The association between youth and beauty has been evident throughout history , particularly in ancient Greece and during the Renaissance . </s>
<s>It is equally apparent today when many people go to considerable lengths to maintain the appearance of youthfulness by the use of vitamins , beauty preparations of all descriptions , hormone treatment , plastic surgery and much else besides . </s>
<s>The link that is assumed between beauty and youth implies a link between old age and ugliness , and is detrimental to older people . </s>
<s>It supports the belief that ageing makes people unattractive , and no longer physically or sexually interesting . </s>
<s>The impact on older women is greater than for older men , as dominant sexist ideas have created the belief that being attractive is more important for women . </s>
<s>Consequently , dual standards are applied . </s>
<s>Eyebrows are raised considerably higher by the idea of an older woman with her ‘ toy boy ’ than an older man with a much younger girlfriend . </s>
<s>Structural ageism </s>
<s>The most pernicious aspect of ageism is not that which is present in the minds and attitudes of individuals , but that which is confirmed and reinforced by the functions and rules of everyday social life . </s>
<s>The structural analysis of ageing has become increasingly prominent in recent years . </s>
<s>The close association between productivity and social status within the ‘ work cultures ’ of Western capitalist societies has been well documented . </s>
<s>Marx believed that capitalist values were completely determined by considerations of productivity . </s>
<s>Weber saw capitalism as characterised by an emphasis on work and activity and highlighted the effect this had on the moral as well as the economic and political development of a society . </s>
<s>Durkheim recognised this too when he defined the ‘ division of labour ’ as a system of moral integration as well as economic production . </s>
<s>This analysis has had important implications for older people . </s>
<s>Compulsory retirement enforces non-productivity , depresses social status , and promotes the idea of old people as a burden . </s>
<s>It is the basis for age discrimination through neglect . </s>
<s>Medical , educational and social service provision becomes a low priority if it is considered that there is only a marginal return on such investment . </s>
<s>The result is that ageism is at its most vicious when older people compete for limited resources , for they are often denied equal access — solely by virtue of their age . </s>
<s>The structural confirmation of ageism is vitally significant . </s>
<s>If age discrimination was entirely a matter of individual attitudes it could be more easily tackled . </s>
<s>It is when ageist attitudes become part of the rules of institutions , govern the conduct of social life , and blend imperceptibly into everyday values and attitudes that they have a drastic effect on the way older people lead their lives . </s>
<s>Descriptions of how this is done are found in subsequent chapters . </s>
<s>Their combined conclusion is a dramatic one . </s>
<s>Older people , on the basis of chronological age , are progressively removed from economic life , which provides them not only with income , but structures their daily routines and integrates them into regular social relationships . </s>
<s>Compulsory retirement places older people in a no-win situation ; they are not allowed to work in order to earn their living , nevertheless , their enforced lack of productivity makes them a ‘ burden ’ , and serves to devalue them . </s>
<s>The most immediate effect of retirement is a dramatic reduction in living standards . </s>
<s>Our welfare state encourages , even ensures , poverty among retired people . </s>
<s>State pensions have remained fixed at subsistence levels . </s>
<s>Non-means-tested welfare benefits display many features of structural ageism . </s>
<s>The maximum social security payments for older people living in residential care homes are lower than for younger , physically handicapped people . </s>
<s>Other disablement benefits can not be claimed once an individual has reached pensionable age , implying that disability is a normal part of old age . </s>
<s>The perception that disability is age-related ultimately influences the take-up rate of these benefits , for many older frail people fail to claim allowances to which they are entitled because they assume that their problems result from old age rather than disability . </s>
<s>The structural neglect of older people reaches its peak when they become frail or dependent . </s>
<s>Ageist attitudes ensure that caring for dependent and vulnerable older people is regarded as a low prestige , low priority enterprise by both health professionals and social workers . </s>
<s>The low standards of residential care have been a topic of concern for many years . </s>
<s>There have been a number of major scandals , the most significant being the Nye Bevan Lodge investigation in 1988 , in which residents were found to have been illegally deprived of their money , made to queue naked for baths , and subjected to other practices which included physical and sexual assault . </s>
<s>It was widely recognised at the time that these practices were the tip of a much larger iceberg of old-age abuse . </s>
<s>I was personally involved in the investigation of a private residential home for older people in Northampton , in which gross practices against residents were uncovered . </s>
<s>Neither of these events , nor other similar ones , have hit the imagination of the media or the public with the same force as the similar serious scandals involving children . </s>
<s>Weaker members of society are always vulnerable to mistreatment . </s>
<s>Abuse of children has been recognised as an important concern because children are seen to represent the future ; to abuse them is to abuse the future welfare of the nation . </s>
<s>Child protection has therefore been given priority status , resulting in a plethora of legislation , directives , regulations and procedures , all adopted to protect the well-being of children . </s>
<s>The abuse of older people has not attained equal priority . </s>
<s>The Northampton investigation centred on an elderly woman , suffering dementia , who was found to have a double fracture of the jaw . </s>
<s>There was no acceptable explanation for the injuries , and the injuries were consistent with a single blow . </s>
<s>Yet the medical authorities would not dearly state this , nor did the police believe that they had a case capable of being taken further , not least because the abused woman could not tell us how it had happened . </s>
<s>While I was personally convinced that abuse had taken place , it appeared that no further action was likely . </s>
<s>The contrast between this inactivity and the action which would have been taken had the injured individual been a young child , was a stark one . </s>
<s>There would have been more medical concern . </s>
<s>The social services would have had powers to protect not only the injured party ( even without evidence that could be proven in court ) , but also all the other children , probably by their removal from the home . </s>
<s>Public concern , legislation , departmental procedures , and pressure on professional staff would have combined to ensure that effective action was taken . </s>
<s>In contrast , lack of public concern , the absence of legislation and departmental procedures , and a general lack of professional concern seemed to conspire in the opposite direction with regard to this elderly woman . </s>
<s>In his survey , the social worker Mervyn Eastman states that ‘ society does not even accept that old-age abuse takes place , let alone appreciate the reasons why it happens . ’ </s>
<s>His view seems to be undeniable in this situation , and it serves to convince me that ageism will never be tackled unless recognition of the problem is followed by the introduction of positive measures . </s>
<s>Yet , Eastman 's statement leads to another vital question that needs to be addressed . </s>
<s>Why is it that structural ageism sanctions discrimination against older people and enables it to continue unnoticed on a daily basis , and remain unchanged over many years ? </s>
<s>Further , how can this situation occur in a society which would consider itself to be both civilised and compassionate in its dealings with older people ? </s>
<s>The denial of ageism and the myth of philanthropy </s>
<s>Despite the widespread ageism which exists at both the individual and structural level , there remains widespread social ignorance and denial of its impact . </s>
<s>The result is that the evidence for ageism remains unaltered , and the assumptions upon which ageism is based are preserved and perpetuated . </s>
<s>In its place has developed the myth of philanthropy . </s>
<s>This is based upon the belief that older people are treated with greater compassion now than ever before . </s>
<s>To confirm this , more comfortable images of old people have been created , enabling us to believe that older people are leading lives which are happy , contented and fulfilled . </s>
<s>These are images of older people as kindly and inoffensive , sitting in front of their fires , or enjoying winter in hotels on the Costa del Sol . </s>
<s>When they do need support , there is the comforting notion that the welfare state and National Health Service are looking after their needs better than ever before . </s>
<s>The denial of ageism can go further , with older people often being blamed for their own situation . </s>
<s>Many professional people , including some gerontologists , consistently emphasise physical psychological and social decline above all other factors in the characteristics and capacities of older people . </s>
<s>In doing so , they reveal how accustomed they have become to working with entrenched and unquestioned assumptions that such loss and decline is caused by age alone . </s>
<s>We have even constructed elaborate theories to make us feel better about the lives older people lead . </s>
<s>The theory of disengagement has led us to believe that it is a normal feature of growing old to withdraw from social life , that isolation and loneliness is a chosen path and not the product of enforced retirement , low income , low status and inadequate social provision . </s>
<s>The result is a tendency to ‘ blame the victim ’ , a belief that older people have caused the plight in which they find themselves . </s>
<s>More convincing is the idea of ‘ structured dependence ’ , which suggests that dependency in old age is more usually a social than a biological or individual creation . </s>
<s>The idea is graphically summarised by Alison Norman : ‘ We are all familiar with the advertisements and Christmas begging letters which ask for money in terms which suggest that old people are in danger of hypothermia or social isolation simply because they are old — not because they do not have sufficient incomes to heat and repair their homes or to pay for a taxi or telephone . ’ </s>
<s>The situation of older people from ethnic-minority communities can be worse . </s>
<s>The assumption that they are not neglected , and that cultural values ensure they will be cared for adequately , has been challenged by Norman . </s>
<s>Her concept of ‘ triple jeopardy ’ demonstrates that elders from such groups suffer from dominant Western social values in three distinct ways : psychologically , bureaucratically and financially . </s>
<s>The myth of philanthropy is quickly discredited by a realistic look at how older people lead their lives . </s>
<s>However , the myth is constantly perpetuated in subtle ways ; for instance , through apparently ‘ charitable ’ views of old age . </s>
<s>In responses to a recent questionnaire from members of Age Concern England 's governing body , it was notable that few saw concessionary entitlement to services as discriminatory and patronising , only necessary in a society which implicitly recognises that older people are not treated fairly . </s>
<s>The special treatment that concessions represent removes from older people the dignity associated with being able to function independently without the need for subsidy or support . </s>
<s>All forms of charity can have the same unfortunate , unintentional impact . </s>
<s>The value of charity is twofold : it is aimed at helping the recipient , but it is also beneficial to the giver . </s>
<s>Charity salves our conscience , allows us to feel that something is being done , that what is being done is sufficient , and that we have played our part in doing it . </s>
<s>This is an integral part of the denial of ageism . </s>
<s>We have old age pensions ; but they are not sufficient . </s>
<s>We have a National Health Service ; but it does not deal adequately with the illnesses of old age . </s>
<s>In similar vein , dare it be said that the charitable function of Age Concern serves this dual function ? </s>
<s>To what extent does its dependence on charitable donations make it an involuntary party in the game of denial ? </s>
<s>If it were more forcefully to challenge the ageism that underlies the social structure , would it be in danger of provoking a backlash from those of its supporters who do not wish to be reminded that all is not well , despite their charity ? </s>
<s>Is Age Concern contributing to the idea that something effective is being done ? </s>
<s>Does it address the issue that it is the impact of social structures on older people that needs to be challenged , and that any amount of charitable good work is not going to fundamentally alter this situation ? </s>
<s>Is it strident enough in stating that not enough is being achieved ? </s>
<s>Despite its undoubted contribution in the past 50 years , perhaps these are questions that it needs to address now it is embarking on the journey to its centenary . </s>
<s>The consequence of the widespread denial of ageism is a strong social taboo surrounding the subject of old age , decline and death . </s>
<s>Simone de Beauvoir asserted that ‘ society looks upon old age as a kind of shameful secret that it is unseemly to mention ’ . </s>
<s>Young people frequently dismiss remarks which older people may make about their impending or eventual death . </s>
<s>Such thoughts are usually considered to be unnecessarily morbid , although the subject is probably more painful for younger people than those who more closely and personally face their own decline and death . </s>
<s>For many older people this taboo is unhelpful and leads to difficulties , including an inability to prepare for and come to terms with the realities of old age , with physical and mental decline , and ultimately with death itself . </s>
<s>Countering ageism </s>
<s>Ageism surrounds us , but it passes largely unnoticed and unchallenged . </s>
<s>Moreover , just like racism and sexism , it is so engrained within the structure of social life that it is unlikely to be challenged effectively by rational argument or appeals to the more philanthropic side of human nature . </s>
<s>There are a number of general strategies which are useful in combating ageism . </s>
<s>Increased awareness is the basis on which they can be developed . </s>
<s>Only when we are more aware of our personal attitudes can we become active in confronting ageism wherever it is encountered . </s>
<s>Mary Marshall explores and develops this vital question in the next chapter . </s>
<s>Ageism-awareness campaigns and anti-ageist strategies , while essential are not sufficient to bring about the level of change which is required . </s>
<s>Age discrimination is so intertwined with the social fabric that legal action must become the major objective . </s>
<s>There are no statutory safeguards against ageist practices , no equivalent of the Race Relations Act or Equal Opportunities legislation . </s>
<s>Legislation will not end ageism , but it will bring the issues into sharper focus and force a re-appraisal of current social practices . </s>
<s>There are several areas in which legal protection is required . </s>
<s>The first of these is in the field of employment . </s>
<s>Legislation is needed to protect the right to employment of older people by outlawing discriminatory practices in advertising and filling job vacancies . </s>
<s>Individuals should also have the right to choose their own time of retirement . </s>
<s>The second area requiring legislation is where older people have been discriminated against to such an extent that they have been put in jeopardy . </s>
<s>Legal safeguards are necessary to protect their money and property and a way should be found to provide security of tenure for dependent older people in residential care . </s>
<s>There should also be legislation which will protect older people against bad practice and abuse in both private and public residential care and nursing homes and in hospitals . </s>
<s>These defensive and protective proposals could be reinforced by a single measure , brilliant in its simplicity , which would guard against old-age discrimination more effectively than any other . </s>
<s>This would be to outlaw general references to age in all current and future legislation where it is used to imply frailty or the need for services . </s>
<s>Such a measure would have a dramatic impact . </s>
<s>For example , the right to work would depend solely upon individual ability to do the job ; the renewal of an annual driving licence after the age of 70 would have to be replaced by measures which are not triggered simply by people reaching a certain age . </s>
<s>The use of the word ‘ age ’ in legislation has helped to create age discrimination . </s>
<s>Age was put alongside grave chronic disease , infirmity or physical incapacity as a qualifier in the 1948 National Assistance Act , and to this day the word continues to be used in legislation as a blanket term to imply dependence . </s>
<s>This practice encourages the belief that old age is a condition similar to disability . </s>
<s>To ban the use of the word in legislation would encourage the awareness that age is not an illness or a disability . </s>
<s>It would encourage the idea that to be old and disabled is not so different from being young and disabled ; that dementia is a mental illness , not an inevitable feature of old age . </s>
<s>It would stress that it is the circumstances and condition of individuals , not their age , that is significant . </s>
<s>Such a move would force a re-appraisal of ageist assumptions and encourage more positive attitudes which judge individual ability according to performance rather than chronological age . </s>
<s>Pessimism about the nature of old age is perhaps the greatest enemy of a happy and fulfilled old age . </s>
<s>To develop more positive images of ageing in this way is not a contrived attempt to pursue attitudes which are unreal , but an effort to seek redress to the current imbalance created by ageism . </s>
<s>The starting point is to accept that each individual develops and evolves throughout life , and that the final stages of life are as important as any other . </s>
<s>As Gore has said : ‘ Life lived as a continuum , is a garnering and enriching experience . </s>
<s>It becomes a process of addition rather than subtraction ; of a growing maturity rather than a loss of youth , of evolution rather than dissolution . </s>
<s>It removes the pernicious , if subconscious obsession with calendar age , which precludes some of us from learning new things , or undertaking new tasks , or taking a new interest in the world around us . ’ </s>
<s>Legislative change would bring about a positive re-assessment of the social role of older people . </s>
<s>It would help to create a more responsive social climate , enabling them to fulfil their potential and conclude their lives with dignity . </s>
<s>Moreover , legislation could galvanise the power of older people , countering the ageist idea that they can not represent their own interests . </s>
<s>The ‘ Grey ’ movement , in the shape of organised pensioners ' groups , is becoming stronger . </s>
<s>I hope they will challenge the images which restrain and persecute older people at present , and seek to shift public attitudes about the nature of old age . </s>
<s>Collectively , older people need to exploit the full potential of their influence , which will only increase as their numbers grow , in order both to maintain responsibility for their own lives , and to demand their full social , political and economic rights . </s>
<s>PROUD TO BE OLD </s>
<s>ATTITUDES TO AGE AND AGEING </s>
<s>MARY MARSHALL </s>
<s>Mary Marshall is the Director of the Dementia Services Development Centre at Stirling University . </s>
<s>She has enjoyed working with older people for nearly 20 years as a social worker , a researcher and most recently as Director of Age Concern Scotland . </s>
<s>She is 44 and believes that we have to learn to talk about our own ageing if we are to effectively link personal and social change . </s>
<s>The vision of Mrs Thatcher raising her arms at the Tory Party Conference and saying she is ‘ proud to be old ’ is so unlikely that it makes us smile . </s>
<s>And yet by most definitions she is old . </s>
<s>She is past the normal age at which women retire and she is entitled to a railcard . </s>
<s>She is a grandmother . </s>
<s>We have to ask ourselves why Mrs Thatcher would never say she was proud to be old . </s>
<s>Why is the word ‘ old ’ so distasteful ? </s>
<s>Why do people use the word as an insult ? </s>
<s>Why do older people not see themselves as old ? </s>
<s>Discrimination is legitimised by negative attitudes and assumptions , and that is why these need to be examined and confronted . </s>
<s>In a Gallup Poll survey conducted for Sidhartha Films Ltd of nearly 1000 people aged over 60 , 78 per cent agreed with the statement ‘ I never think of myself as old ’ , and only 14 per cent disagreed . </s>
<s>If you ask old people whether they ever think of themselves as old , they tell you it is only when they are ill or feeling very unhappy . </s>
<s>From the age of about 40 , people are increasingly ashamed of their ageing . </s>
<s>It is socially very inept to ask someone their age and , if they tell you , it is often in an embarrassed whisper . </s>
<s>I have seen people close to tears as they own up to being over 50 . </s>
<s>Very few people share the view expressed in Time magazine that ‘ Ageing has become very stylish . </s>
<s>All the best people are doing it . ’ </s>
<s>Yet increasing numbers of people in Britain are old : more than ten million are over retirement age today . </s>
<s>As part of the post-war baby bulge , I am confidently expecting to spend at least 20 years in retirement along with an unprecedented number of my peers . </s>
<s>I intend to have a thoroughly enjoyable and lengthy period without paid work . </s>
<s>These expectations are quite remarkable . </s>
<s>The phenomenon of the bulk of the population surviving infancy and living well into their 70s and 80s is quite new and something to be proud of . </s>
<s>Negative attitudes to ageing may , in part , be the result of the time lag between social change and a change in people 's attitudes . </s>
<s>Attitudes are a way of making sense of the world , of organising what we see and what we experience . </s>
<s>Clearly linked to language and concepts which we can put into words , attitudes are usually held collectively . </s>
<s>That is to say that our attitudes are strongly influenced by others : people we mix with , television and radio , papers , magazines and books . </s>
<s>Puffing our experiences and views into words gives them meaning and enables us to feel confident and in control . </s>
<s>Marris and Parkes are both sociologists who have studied bereavement and loss . </s>
<s>They consider that you can only move on from an unhappy experience if you have given it some meaning . </s>
<s>Marris suggests that this personal experience can also be a social phenomenon : families and communities have to give meaning to events to cope with them . </s>
<s>But , of course , having a system of beliefs or attitudes also conditions the way we look at the world ; what we actually see . </s>
<s>It becomes impossible to say which comes first : the attitudes we hold or what we experience . </s>
<s>On a grander scale this is the perennial argument about whether ideologies follow social changes or create them . </s>
<s>It must be an interplay between the two and will vary in different circumstances . </s>
<s>One of the major changes to which our society must give meaning is the increasing number of people over the age of retirement , especially those in their 80s and 90s . </s>
<s>There are always two tasks for professionals involved in social change : to change society for the better and to change attitudes . </s>
<s>The task of this chapter is to look at attitudes to ageing and old people , to look at their consequences and to consider changing them . </s>
<s>Social circumstances and social change is the task of the rest of this book . </s>
<s>Negative attitudes </s>
<s>Many people writing about negative attitudes towards old age suggest that such attitudes are widely held and refer to most old people . </s>
<s>One health visitor , for example , says that : ‘ Society finds it easy to decide when people are old . </s>
<s>Women are old when they reach 60 and men are old at 65 . </s>
<s>Then they can join the ranks of the OAPs , the poor and powerless . ’ </s>
<s>She continues : ‘ Ageism … is a prejudice which enables us all , young and old to consider old people as useless , incontinent , senile , asexual and immobile . ’ </s>
<s>This passionate article was written in 1985 , and the rapidity of social change and changes in attitude since then , already make some qualification necessary . </s>
<s>Although these negative attitudes remain , they are directed more at some groups than others . </s>
<s>There is a greater recognition than there was five years ago that the ten million people over retirement age are not homogeneous . </s>
<s>Indeed , they are much less alike than any other group of people whose ages span 40 years , because we all become less alike as we grow older . </s>
<s>We all develop throughout our lives , but experiences affect and change us differently . </s>
<s>There is often a legitimate but hazy division into two ‘ groups ’ of older people : the young , recently retired and the older group . </s>
<s>Obviously , however , these two groups differ according to your viewpoint ; for example , on the basis of the extent of poor physical and mental health , on the proportions of men and women , on the extent of poverty and poor housing and the numbers living alone . </s>
<s>There is no clear line between one group and another , and the differences are only relative . </s>
<s>There is a clearly perceptible change of attitude by the public and the people themselves to the relatively affluent and healthy newly retired : the Jollies Jet-Setting Oldies with Lots of Loot ) and the Woopies ( Well-Off Older People ) . </s>
<s>These fortunate people are able to seize the opportunities of more leisure time . </s>
<s>They have also attracted their own market in terms of housing , holidays , magazines , insurance and even a whole weekend supplement of the Financial Times ( 6 January 1990 ) . </s>
<s>They are thus highly visible . </s>
<s>They are the ‘ stylish ageing ’ , but they are not a majority . </s>
<s>Many of their pees are much less visible because they are cares trapped at home or are struggling to make ends meet . </s>
<s>In spite of their being only a minority of the pensioner population , affluent , active , newly retired people are slowly changing public attitudes . </s>
<s>They are not seen as ‘ old ’ . </s>
<s>Increasingly , negative attitudes are towards older , frailer people , who are now the main victims of ageism . </s>
<s>A study published by Age Concern Scotland concluded : ‘ Ageism leads to a perception of old age as an affliction or disease which turns us into a special kind of being which is not fully human . ’ </s>
<s>Another change in recent years is that most people have become aware of the term ‘ ageism ’ , but there is still little effort to understand its causes and consequences . </s>
<s>The media </s>
<s>The media are crucially important in any contemporary discussion of attitudes . </s>
<s>As a BBC resource pack states , ‘ the media , in the way they portray older people , tend to mirror society 's beliefs about old age . ’ </s>
<s>Attitudes in the media are slowly changing , but we are still presented with stereotyped images of older people . </s>
<s>It is encouraging that the National Union of Journalists has now inserted an anti-ageist clause into its code of conduct . </s>
<s>Most of us , however , are aware that tabloid newspapers still talk patronisingly about ‘ old folk ’ , but the ageism of serious journals and newspapers is not always recognised . </s>
<s>Respondents to a questionnaire on age discrimination from members of Age Concern England 's governing body highlighted this point . </s>
<s>They felt that the press laid too great an emphasis on the frailty of older people and situations where they were in danger , rather than showing them as active members of the community . </s>
<s>Anyone over 60 , they thought , was labelled ‘ aged ’ . </s>
<s>Moreover , older people are often treated as if they were not adult , and are patronised by journalists who ask questions like : ‘ How do you put your grandmother in a home ? ’ </s>
<s>The authors of the BBC resource pack identify the influential role played by television in the debate . </s>
<s>Indeed , they conclude that ‘ it is television that gives millions of people their basic idea of reality ’ , and this may be particularly true for older people , who on average watch 33 hours of television a week , 11 hours more than the national average . </s>
<s>While special programmes for older viewers undoubtedly offer information and support , television companies may use them as an excuse for not including realistic portrayals of older people in their mainstream peak-time programmes . </s>
<s>For example , many soap operas omit older people entirely , as if we were all perpetually middle-aged ! </s>
<s>Elsewhere , particularly in sitcoms , older people are crudely portrayed as being either enfeebled , vague and forgetful or , at the other extreme , cantankerous battle axes . </s>
<s>On the news and in documentaries , as in the press , there is a concentration of stories about attacks on elderly people or abuse in old people 's homes , which inevitably reinforces fear about old age . </s>
<s>These are all editorial choices , and few of them create positive images for television audiences . </s>
<s>Until we have older people formulating policy , producing documentaries , reading the news and fronting arts and cultural programmes , we will not have removed ageism from television . </s>
<s>Well-respected older male broadcasters like David Jacobs and Robert Dougall may continue to get the opportunity to host programmes aimed particularly at older people , but they will no longer present mainstream programmes . </s>
<s>Older women will continue to disappear from public view altogether . </s>
<s>In any discussion about the influence of the media over our perception of reality , it is important to recognise that millions of people form an idea of reality which is based firmly on experience , not on media images , and that these millions include most older people . </s>
<s>Nevertheless , the media — particularly television — has enormous power ; they can undoubtedly reinforce or fail to challenge attitudes in us all . </s>
<s>The formation of attitudes </s>
