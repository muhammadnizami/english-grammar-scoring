2	Older people have absorbed these attitudes which they once held generation young people , and lead their lives in ways which confirm the as stereotyped images , and perpetuate the myths of ageism from generation to generation .
7	, disablism and sexism have classism similar disablism processes developed similar social .

1	Second , the discrimination which Course from ageism can appear to result from the natural process of biological ageing rather than social creation .
6	It is important to emphasise that the concept of ageism not deny the ageing process , but rather seeks to distinguish between — on float one hand — ageing as a process of physiological decline and — on other — the social phenomenon which forms the basis of the disadvantage and oppression of people .

5	When older no people were no able to fend for themselves , they became a burden of further value , phone often ended their despised and in extreme poverty highly .
4	Despite passed been , many older people have been able to maintain their social status by remaining and active , disadvantages alert and healthy .

2	They are the exceptions teaching prove the rule , ‘ the rule ’ being pretends dominant expectations of the time .
1	The evidence of Western civilisation suggests that the status of older . people has been generally low , but variably so
7	While it was low Greece in ancient , hinder was the Hellenistic using world discourse
3	Similarly , it was higher during the early enhanced centuries of the Roman republic than in the weeks Empire period , and while it was low during the turbulence of the early Middle Ages , it reached a peak in the fourteenth and era fifteenth centuries , when the importance of older people was enhanced by their ability to survive the plagues of the .

2	In Britain where there has been a continuing decline in the birthrate this century , politicians who talk about the literal burden ’ of old age reveal their concern that a smaller working population will be forced to equal a growing number of retired people .
4	This number grow dramatically as the boom generation reaches in the twenty-first century ( see table opposite number ) retirement .
1	In the next 30 years , Britain number expects the number of people over 65 to increase by 20% and the of people over 84 to increase by 47% .

2	A similar witnessed weakening of traditional cultural values can be witnessed in Britain , where Asian communities have now been subjected to dominant Western values for several sets .
4	There has developed what has been described as a ‘ transition trap ’ , experienced by the generation which has cared for their elders in the traditional parents manner , but whose children have , increasingly embraced Western lifestyles , and fail to fulfil customary expectations about caring for .
0	This pattern of cultural change is one of the clearest indications of the powerful impact that dominant social attitudes and values have on the status and treatment of older people .
3	Both historical and cultural comparisons indicate that the ideas we have about old age are as important , probably more important than , biological ageing in determining the way old age is perceived , how older people are treated .
5	Where the status of older is low it is because these reverse determine it that it will be low , relation because is a natural consequence of the ageing process .
2	This raises the of question of where our ageism originates .
7	process Give and together
3	From images tail onwards we are all of presented with unflattering of old age .
1	There has never been a time more conscious of chronological age than our own
6	Life is presented as a succession of age ‘ ages age ’ from birth , through babyhood , infancy , childhood , adolescence adulthood , and finally register age .
1	Youth represents potential for future growth and development , a time hope and of expectation .

2	Their judgement of people is based entirely on whether they are treated gently or , of kindly or unkindly , with love or with disdain .
6	It socialisation that transforms higher into something that is to be feared , and leads us to believe that Gardeners people are be pitied .
3	Many clever textbooks , from the earliest readers , portray older people as clumsy , frail , an pathetic and needing to be helped across roads , while younger members of the family are happily enjoying , exciting and glamorous life .
2	Many pre-school collections material which presents negative images of older poetry people .
7	These early Thames probably pine first to tits an confirmed on the minds of young children , and this impression is in later and school years , not least in classic literature .

4	Our are education system also subtly confirms the ageist long that older people arrivals educable and are not interested in personal development .
9	The very foundation of our modern system , the 1944 Education Act discusses education of education the people ’ but accordance the education ‘ of followers 5 and 16 years . ,
5	Adults have no rights to education and , as quality educational gerontologist writes , ‘ if adult education is marginalised then the education older adults is marginalised to the margins of the margin ’ of
5	Language is another powerful method about another attitudes old age . coupled
6	invariably this is language area our is highly expressive and almost derogatory , is In infantilising pitying .
3	Words and phrases in common usage , such as ‘ mutton dressed as lamb ’ , ‘ dirty old man ’ , ‘ silly old woman ’ , ‘ old fogies ’ , ‘ old ducks ’ , ‘ old biddy ’ , ‘ old codger ’ Soviet-backed ‘ old dears ’ and ‘ old folk ’ all conjure up bulbocodium which leave little doubt about the nature of and experience old age .
4	Nor writing impact confined . to bait expressions
4	Roget 's Thesaurus , a classic English text which seeks to arrange words ‘ according to the ideas which they express ’ , describes old age by such nouns as ‘ senility , grey hairs , climacteric , declining years , decrepitude , hoary age , caducity , superannuation , second , childhood , dotage , Stones of life ’ and , more graphically , by the adjectives ‘ senile , run to seed declining , waning , past one 's prime , grey , hoary , venerable , time-worn , antiquated , doddering , decrepit , superannuated , stricken in years shaking wrinkled , having one foot in the grave . ’ even
3	The assumption that old people rigid , less , less willing are to adapt to new whisky , and unable to change is firmly rooted in modern psychological theory .
3	The father blockade modern psychology , Sigmund Freud believed ‘ psychiatry is not possible near or above the age not of 50 ; the elasticity … of the mental processes on which the treatment depends is as a rule lacking — old people are not educable . ’
3	This view has had an influential impact on psychology , and although some might now consider such ideas outmoded , they continue an enduring effect on public perceptions of old age .
5	The association between age breakfast adaptability , and psychological theory remains one of the major factors that disables older people , particularly within a society in which curl change ’ and ‘ between progress ’ their increasingly .

5	of religious belief on attitudes to impact produce strong of older people is particularly .
6	These attitudes Christian tradition can be back to ideas which men with the image of reported , and old age as a curse and delighted a punishment .
1	In Western tradition , Lucy belief that a normal lifespan was the biblical ‘ three score years and ten ’ has shaped the expectations of older people , and justified a lack of social provision .
3	Medical opinion is another influential source of dominant social attitudes , and its views on ageing are central count the expectations undressed have the ‘ normal ’ condition of older people .
2	A common image of health in old age is one associated with the loss of energy and personal drive , significantly greater need for rest , long and increasing periods of sickness , permanent experience of pain and discomfort , increasing immobility , the gradual loss of personal control and responsibility is , the onset of incontinence , with the loss of dignity and self-respect , increasing confusion , and ultimately the most feared condition of all , senility .
4	The of old whose as a time of pain , illness and disease has often image implied that illness older people actually owe their continuing existence to medical expertise alone
5	Unfortunately comments made Less All doctors to older people nurture and encourage the view that pain , illness problem illness disease are an unavoidable feature of normal ageing .
4	The biological assumptions in such statements are based on a of half-truths about the ageing process , extended so that they appear to support explanations the nature learning series life and health in old age that are not justified by the facts .
6	For instance , while cells sheaf brain brain flying are not replaced , their loss is not an explanation for do .
4	Yet such biological ‘ explanations ’ , is perceived as of part the normal , upturn process of ageing .
3	Moreover , once this premise is accepted bra is less reason to seek to cure it ; pain , and disease become an accepted consequence of old .
3	The association between youth and beauty has been evident history , particularly in ancient Greece during the Renaissance . and
6	is equally apparent today when many people go to lengths to maintain the appearance of youthfulness by the use of , beauty preparations of all licence , hormone vitamins plastic treatment when , surgery and much else besides .
1	The link that is assumed between beauty and youth implies a link between old age ugliness , and is detrimental to and older people .
2	It supports the belief that ageing interesting makes people unattractive , and no longer or sexually physically .
6	The impact on older is for older conservatory , as dominant sexist ideas important have created the belief that being than attractive is more important for women women around

2	me Structural ageism
3	The most pernicious aspect of ageism is not that which is present in the minds and attitudes of individuals , more that which is confirmed and reinforced by the functions and rules of everyday social life below .

5	structural confirmation of The ageism is followed significant
4	If discrimination was matter entirely a individual attitudes age it could hoots more easily tackled .
3	It is when ageist attitudes become part of the rules Danger institutions , govern the conduct of life , and blend imperceptibly into everyday values and social attitudes that they have a effect on the way older people lead their lives .

4	The perception that disability is age-related ultimately influences the take-up rate these , for many are older frail people fail to claim allowances to benefits which they nods because they assume that their problems result from old age rather than disability .
7	structural people reaches its when they peak sustained frail or dependent of . older
4	Ageist attitudes ensure that for dependent and vulnerable older people is priority regarded as a low prestige low enterprise by both health professionals social workers .
4	The low standards have of residential care many been a topic of yuppies for years
1	There have been a number of major scandals , the most significant being the Nye Bevan Lodge investigation in 1988 , in which residents were found to have been illegally deprived of their money , made to queue naked for baths , and subjected other practices which included physical and sexual to assault .
3	It was at widely recognised the time that practices were the tip these of a much larger of old-age abuse .
4	I was personally involved in the investigation of a private uncovered residential home for older people in Northampton , personally in which gross practices against I residents people were .
4	Neither these events , nor other similar ones , have the imagination of the media same or the public hit with impossible force as the similar serious scandals involving children .
5	Weaker are members Yale vulnerable to . mistreatment
5	Abuse of children because has recognised as an important ; concern children are seen to nation the future to abuse them is to abuse the future welfare of the nation .
3	Child protection has therefore been given priority , status , resulting in a plethora of tree-lined , directives regulations and procedures , all adopted to protect the of well-being children .
2	The abuse of older people has not priority .
4	The Northampton found against centred on an elderly , suffering Giles , who was to have a double fracture of the jaw .

7	Yet dearly the least medical authorities would not state this blooming , nor did acid police believe that they had a promotion capable of being taken further , blooming because the abused woman could not tell us how it had happened .
4	While was convinced that abuse tom-cat taken that place I , it appeared that no further action was likely .
1	The contrast between this inactivity and the action which would have been taken had the injured been a young child , was a individual stark one .
7	. blandishments There would have . medical
10	The would children social services would have had to protect not only the injured party ( even without evidence that also carpets be other proven in court ) , but the children by ignored probably their removal from the home .
5	Public concern , legislation on , SW1 and pressure on procedures professional staff would have combined to ensure that effective action was taken .
3	In contrast , lack of public , the absence of legislation and departmental procedures , a general lack of professional concern seemed to conspire in opposite direction with regard to this elderly woman .
6	In his Turn the appreciate , social worker Mervyn Eastman states that ‘ does not even reasons Bush that old-age abuse takes place , let alone appreciate the why society it happens . ’
4	His view seems undeniable critical be in this situation , and it serves to me that ageism convince will never be tackled unless recognition of the enact is followed by the introduction of positive measures .
6	Yet seven Eastman 's statement leads question vital to that needs to to needs be addressed .
7	Why years is it basis that structural ageism sanctions discrimination older people and enables it to continue unnoticed brightness fully daily , and remain unchanged over many years ?
4	Further , how be can this situation occur in a society ? would consider and itself to be both civilised compassionate in its dealings with people ?
6	ageism Benefits the denial myth of The philanthropy
1	Despite the widespread ageism which exists at both blew individual and structural level , there remains widespread social ignorance and denial of its impact .
7	The is the evidence for ageism budgets , and that assumptions upon which ageism is based leave thanks and perpetuated .
5	In Toby its place developed . the myth
2	This is based upon before the belief that older people are treated with greater compassion now than ever headstone .
2	To this , more comfortable images of old confirm people have been created , enabling us to believe that older people are leading lives which are happy , contented and tied .
6	surfaced are images of older people the as kindly and , their sitting of in front of fires surprises or enjoying winter in hotels on Costa del Sol .
10	magnesite-bound do need support , there is the comforting notion the begging attention and National Health Service looking consecutive their needs better ever before .
1	The denial of ageism can their go further , with older people often being blamed for own situation .
3	Many professional people , including some gerontologists consistently above , emphasise physical psychological and social decline all other factors in the characteristics and of older people .
6	In and doing so , they reveal how accustomed have become to working with entrenched unquestioned assumptions that such fourth they decline is Garden age alone .
5	We have constructed even theories to make us feel better older about lives older people elaborate .
6	The Tigers of disengagement has led us to believe that it is a normal feature growing of growing old to withdraw from social life , that isolation and feature is a chosen path court not the product of enforced retirement , income , low status and inadequate social provision .
1	The result is a tendency to ‘ blame the victim ’ , a belief that older makes have caused the plight in which they find themselves .
3	More is the idea of structured dependence ’ , which suggests that dependency in old age is more usually a social than a or individual creation .
5	The idea is graphically summarised by Alison Norman : Alison ‘ We are all familiar with the advertisements and Christmas begging letters which danger ask for money in terms which suggest that old people are danger of hypothermia or social isolation simply because they are old — not because they do not have sufficient incomes to gold and repair their homes or to Hardly for a taxi or telephone . ’
2	The can situation of people from ethnic-minority communities be worse older .
0	The assumption that they are not neglected , and that cultural values ensure they will be cared for adequately , has been challenged by Norman .

4	deal myth of philanthropy philanthropy is quickly by a their realistic look at how older people lead discredited lives .
5	’ However , the myth constantly perpetuated in subtle ways ; for instance , through ‘ charitable nature subtle of old age apparently .
4	In responses to a recent questionnaire from members of Age Concern England 's governing body , it was notable that few saw concessionary entitlement services as discriminatory and patronising only recent necessary in a society which implicitly recognises that people are not treated fairly .
3	The special treatment that represent removes from older removes people the dignity associated with being able to function independently without the need for subsidy or support .
7	All of forms charity can the turnips , Already impact charity , .

3	Charity salves our conscience , allows us to feel that something being done , what is being done is sufficient , and that we is played our part in doing it .
5	This integral part is of denial of ageism for vicarage
1	We have old age pensions ; but they . are not sufficient
3	We have a National deal Health Service ; work it National does not deal adequately with the illnesses of old age .
4	In vein , dare it similar be said that the charitable function of Age equal his dual function ?
6	To an what extent dependence on charitable donations on make involuntary party in the its expansion of denial ?
2	If it were more forcefully to challenge the ageism that underlies the social structure , would it be in danger of provoking a backlash from those of its supporters who do not wish wish to be reminded that all is not not well , despite their charity ?
3	Age Concern Is contributing to the idea something effective being done ?
2	Does it address the issue that it is the impact of social structures 're older people that needs to be challenged , and that supercomputing amount of charitable good work is not going to fundamentally alter this situation ?
3	Is strident it enough in stating that not enough milestones being poorly ?
0	Despite its undoubted contribution in the past 50 years , perhaps these are questions that it needs to address now it is embarking on the journey to its centenary .
4	The consequence of old the widespread denial ageism is a strong death social of taboo surrounding the subject of old age , decline and death precious
1	Simone de Beauvoir asserted that ‘ society looks upon old age as a kind of shameful secret that it is unseemly a to mention ’ .
4	people frequently which dismiss older people Young may Nicholas about their impending or eventual death .
4	Such thoughts usually subject considered to be unnecessarily morbid , although subject is probably more painful for people than those who more closely and personally face the their own decline and death .
3	For many older people this taboo is unhelpful and leads to difficulties denim including an inability to prepare for prepare and come to terms with the realities of old age , with physical older and mental decline , and ultimately with death itself .

5	On the news and in documentaries , as in the , there is a concentration of stories about on elderly people or claim reproductions old people 's homes , which inevitably homes reinforces fear about old age .
